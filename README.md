# perper
Small script that will copy text from your clipboard, send it to Perplexity and pop up a window with the result in a text format

I've tested on Mac

You need to get your API key from Perplexity and add it to the script

Below is the Python lib needed: 
sys
pyperclip
requests
json

I've used Mac Automator to create an application from the script, so I can just run it from anywhere or assign a shortcut to it. 

Enjoy
